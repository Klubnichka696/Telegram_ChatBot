# Telegram_ChatBot

This Telegram bot serves as a convenient aggregator of travel offers, providing users with up-to-date information about available flights and hotels. It is important to note that StayFlyBot does not make reservations or purchases directly — its task is to search, filter and demonstrate the best options, after which the bot provides links to official sources for ordering.

Integrated with professional travel APIs, the bot collects data from trusted vendors, allowing you to compare hundreds of options in seconds. Users can apply smart filters by price, dates, airlines, class of service and other parameters, and after saving their favorite offers to favorites, return to them later.

The special feature of StayFlyBot's work lies in its transparency — all the options found are accompanied by links to the official websites of airlines, hotels or trusted aggregators, where you can safely complete your booking. The bot also provides useful tips: it recommends the optimal time to purchase tickets, points out special promotions and helps to avoid common mistakes when choosing.

The technical platform is built on Python using the python-telegram-bot library and the Finite State Machine system for easy navigation. Integration with external APIs is carried out through secure protocols, and user data (search history, favorites) is stored locally in JSON format.

StayFlyBot is your personal search assistant that saves time on trip planning. It does not replace booking services, but makes their use more convenient by providing all the necessary information in one place and directing you to official sources to complete the transaction.

To work with the bot, Python version 3.7 and higher is required, with minimal configuration. The development plans include expanding the list of integrated providers, adding a price change notification system, and improving search personalization algorithms.
